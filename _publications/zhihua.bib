  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a numerical investigation of a plunging wave impact event in a low-filling depressurised sloshing tank using a compressible multiphase flow model implemented in open-source CFD software. The main focus of this study is on the hydrodynamic loadings that impinge on the vertical wall of the tank. The detailed numerical solutions compare well with experimental results and confirm that an air trapped plunging wave impact causes the vertical wall to experience pulsating pressure loadings in which alternate positive and negative gauge pressures occur in sequence following the first applied pressure peak. The strongest pulsations of the pressure are found to be near the air pocket trapped by the water mass. The instantaneous pressure distribution along the vertical wall is nearly uniform in the area contained by the air pocket. The phases of pulsating pressures on the wall are in synchronisation with the expansion and contraction of the trapped air pocket. The pocket undergoes changes in shape, moves upwards with the water mass and eventually breaks up into small parts. A careful integration of the wall pressure reveals that the vertical structure as a whole experiences pulsating horizontal impact forces. It is found that the average period of pulsation cycles predicted in the present study is around 5驕ｯ�ｽｶ�ｿｽ�ｽｿ�ｽｽ6 ms, and the loading pulsations are quickly damped out in View the MathML source0.1驕ｯ�ｽｶ�ｿｽ�ｽｿ�ｽｽ0.2s. Further exploratory investigation of the fluid thermodynamics reveals that the temperature inside the trapped air pocket rises quickly for about 2 ms synchronised with the pocket's first contraction, then the generated heat is rapidly transferred away in around 3 ms.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a numerical wave tank based on the overset mesh approach. Overset mesh is favourable to the moving mesh method owing to its ability to represent complex geometries whilst maintaining a good quality mesh, especially for large amplitude body motions. The numerical wave tank is developed by integrating a generic overset mesh functionality with an efficient wave generation library in OpenFOAM. A series of benchmark test cases, including 2D regular waves interacting with a floating cylinder and box-shaped body with superstructures, 2D water entry of a rigid wedge and a ship hull section as well as the heave decay of a point absorber wave energy converter and the lifeboat motion in regular waves, are carried out to evaluate the capabilities of the developed numerical wave tank. The computed solutions agree well with the experimental data and other reference results reported in the literature, which demonstrates the capability of the numerical wave tank for modelling flow around structures with complex geometries under various wave conditions. The parallel efficiency of the solver, effects of the overlapping area on the solution accuracy and comparisons with the results from a dynamic mesh are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper presents a new integrated (hybrid) hydrodynamic numerical model which couples a finite volume-based fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) solver with an incompressible two-phase Navier-Stokes (NS) solver in OpenFOAM. The coupling procedure follows a domain (zonal) decomposition approach in which an overlapping relaxation zone is utilised to implement a weak (one-way) coupling. The method for transferring information is simple, and the coupling accurate. Indeed, given that both solvers have been developed in OpenFOAM and are finite volume-based, only a method to calculate the volume fraction from the free-surface elevation has to be implemented: the velocity and pressure are already calculated as part of the FNPF solution and can be transferred accordingly — simplifying things greatly and avoiding unwanted errors. In addition, existing advanced OpenFOAM functionalities are used for the required interpolation. The relaxation zone then also ensures the coupling process is stable through a smooth transition from the FNPF solution to the N-S solution, as well as by absorbing any reflected waves. The new model is then validated through a number of benchmark test cases involving wave propagation, transformation, and structure interaction. It is shown to produce accurate numerical solutions that agree well with existing theoretical results and experimental data.}},

Without prior access to the physical data, participants, with numerical methods ranging from low-fidelity linear models to fully non-linear Navier竏担tokes (NS) solvers, simulate the interaction between focused wave events and two separate, taut-moored, floating structures: a hemispherical-bottomed cylinder and a cylinder with a moonpool. The 窶話lind窶� numerical predictions for heave, surge, pitch and mooring load, are compared against physical measurements. Dynamic time warping is used to quantify the predictive capability of participating methods. In general, NS solvers and hybrid methods give more accurate predictions; however, heave amplitude is predicted reasonably well by all methods; and a WEC-Sim implementation, with CFD-informed viscous terms, demonstrates comparable predictive capability to even the stronger NS solvers. Large variations in the solutions are observed (even among similar methods), highlighting a need for standardisation in the numerical modelling of WSI problems.},

  abstract = {Abstract An immersed boundary method is applied to simulate the green water over a fixed deck by combining a level set method for the free water surface capturing. An efficient Navier-Stokes equation solver of second-order accuracy adopting the fractional step method at a staggered Cartesian grid system is used to solve the incompressible fluid motion. The numerical model is validated by comparing extensively the wave elevation and pressure with the experimental data for two types of fixed decks, which suggests that the developed immersed boundary method coupled with the level set method is very promising to predict green water problems due to its accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, the cross-sectional velocity distribution over the deck, which is an important parameter in the industrial application, is computed and compared to the analytical Ritter's solution. It is found that Ritter's solution is much more conservative than the numerical simulations, which confirms the safe application of the simplified analytical solution in the current design practise. Volume of green water over the deck that affects the stability of deck is also tracked. The numerical results reveal that the amount of green water over both the two types of fixed decks shows a linear relationship with the relative wave height. This important finding may be very helpful for the prediction of deck elevation under a certain wave condition to reduce the occurrence of green water event.},
